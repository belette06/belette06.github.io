				<div >
					<p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>
				</div>

			<h2 >Let it breathe</h2>

				<div >
					<p >Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <code>line-height: 1.4</code> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.
					If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>
				</div>

			<h2 >A little less contrast</h2>

				<div >
					<p >Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice <code>#EEEEEE</code> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>
				</div>

			<h2 >Size Matters</h2>
				<div >
					<p >I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to 	render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>
				</div>
			<h2 >Line-width, motherfucker</h2>

				<div >
					<p >Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
				</div>

			<h3 >Yes, this is <em>also</em> fucking satire, you fuck</h3>

				<div >
					<p >I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this 	site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.
